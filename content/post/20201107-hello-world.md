My goal here is not to competent in the attention economy.
The hope is to create a space where I can
write about side projects,
topics that I find to be important,
and
my adventures outside of the digital world.

```java
abstract class Kmack implements SoftwareEngineer, Backpacker, MountaineerWannaBe {}
```

I have been wanting to start building this space for some time.

GitLab's native support for Hugo is pretty awesome.
I went from zero to one on getting this blog up and running in about 5 minutes.
