Here are the highlights:

* My name is Kevin Macksamie.
* I've been developing software professionally for over 12 years.
* I'm kind of obsessed with WebAssembly.

More importantly, what am I trying to do here?
I write a lot of technical content at my day job, but I don't get to add any of my own personality to it, if you know what I mean.
I have to be very, well, _professional_, which means I

* avoid personal pronouns,
* avoid contractions
* am terse,
* don't use adverbs unless I have data to justify their use, and
* avoid talking about work that is underdeveloped.

There are more restrictions, but you get the idea.
This site is space for me to write about what I want, _how_ I want.
Thanks for checking it out!
