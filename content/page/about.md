Here are the highlights:

* My name is Kevin Macksamie.
* I've been developing software professionally for over 12 years.
* I'm kind of obsessed with WebAssembly.

More importantly, what am I trying to do here?
I write a lot of technical content at my day job, but I don't get to add any of my own personality to it, if you know what I mean.
I have to be very, well, _professional_, which means

* I avoid personal pronouns, adverbs, and contractions;
* I keep sentences terse;
* and I don't include underdeveloped ideas, designs, and implementations.

There are more restrictions, but you get the idea.
This site is a space for me to write about what I want, _how_ I want.
Thanks for checking it out!

BTW, [gully-fluff is pocket lint](https://books.google.com/books?id=JRuNMHNcu5cC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&lpg=PA2319&dq=%22Gully-Fluff%22&pg=PA2319#v=onepage&q=%22Gully-Fluff%22&f=false),
which I think is a good metaphor for my writings:
they're kind of the remaining bits of creativity I can dig up at the end of the day.
But truthfully, I just love hearing the word [when said by an angry owl.](https://youtu.be/U3fyC0MkdtI?si=u27RXImr9UCCOL-O&t=9)
